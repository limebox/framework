If you want to use the provided git hooks with your system, make sure you run "setup_hooks.sh" from the command line, or move the hooks into the ./.git/hooks directory and make sure they have the required permissions.

Note: Windows machines do not need to provide permissions, and the setup_hooks.sh file will only work from the git bash terminal.

Command:
sh setup_hooks.sh
